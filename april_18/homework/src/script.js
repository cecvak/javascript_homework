// 1. Create a “groceries list” array. 
// Each element of the array is an object that contains the name of a product, 
// an amount needed and a property saying whether it is bought or not. 
// Write a few functions for working with this array: 
// 1) Function for displaying the entire list; 
// 2) Function for adding a purchase to the list. 
//     Note that if a product already exists in the array, the amount needs 
//     to be increased in the existing purchase, not in a new one; 
// 3) Function for purchasing a product. The function accepts the name of a product and marks it as bought.




// 2. Create an array of classrooms. 
// A classroom object consists of a name, 
// a number of seats (10 to 20) and the faculty it is meant for. 
// Write a few functions for working with it: 
// 1) Display all the classrooms; 
// 2) Display all the classrooms for a given faculty; 
// 3) Display only the classrooms that would fit a given group. 
//     A group object contains a name, the number of students, and the faculty name.
