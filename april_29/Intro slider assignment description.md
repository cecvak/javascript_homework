# Slick slider assignment

Open the `Intro slide.fig` file to see the design. Create a page according to the design. You can use CSS or SCSS. The fonts used in the design are available on Google Fonts website. You can add any content to the slides that are not shown in the design.

You can make the page responsive if you want. You can modify the slick slider options so that it will be responsive automatically - see an example and read about the `responsive` setting on the [official website](https://kenwheeler.github.io/slick/).
