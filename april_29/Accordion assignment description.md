# jQuery accordion

Open the `Accordion.fig` file to see the design. Create a page with the accordion. Use CSS or SCSS for styling. You don't need to make the page responsive. Use jQuery to write logic that will open/hide the content below each section when clicking on the section title. The section title is the container that has an icon and a section name (Location, Music, Notes, Books, Tendances).

To connect the external font, use `@font-face` CSS rule. You can read about it [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@font-face).
